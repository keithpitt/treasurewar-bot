# Treasure Wars Example Bot

See the rules of treasure wars [here](http://github.com/mtcmorris/treasurewar).

## Developing

Place your logic/code in the designated spot in `bot.rb`. Random bot is not very smart - perhaps you could make him `pick up` treasure if he sees it...

Getting started:

    bundle
    bundle exec ruby bot.rb

You may need to edit the bot connection url in bot.rb
